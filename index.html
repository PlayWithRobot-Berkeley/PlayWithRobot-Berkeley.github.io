    <p>The project aims to utilise the Sawyer robotic arm to solve mathematical problems. 
      The Sawyer robotic arm is expected to read the handwritten mathematical problems on 
      a random whiteboard placed inside its working space, interpret the problems, 
      generate the corresponding solutions and write them down on whiteboards.
